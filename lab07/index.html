<h1>Abby Baughan's Biography</h1>
<p>
 My name is Abby Baughan and I am a sophomore studying Magazine, News and Digital Journalism at Syracuse University.  I am interested in reporting on our campus community, specifically culture pieces such as upcoming concerts, new artists, and events. 

In my time here at Syracuse, I have developed a unique set of skills that would make me a great addition to many organizations. The past three semesters, I have made the Dean’s List in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.  Additionally, I work for <strong>The Women’s Network</strong> as a blog writer and have written multiple articles for The Daily Orange in the past. With my graphic design and video courses, I gained experience with the following software:</p>
<ul>
    <li>InDesign</li>
    <li>Illustrator</li>
    <li>Photoshop</li>
    <li>Premiere Pro</li>
</ul>

<p>
Outside of my academics, I am a part of the SU Ski Race Club team.  It is a great way to pass the time with people during the cold winters here at SU.  I also love to watch movies and read books. Some of my favorites are Harry Potter, Downton Abbey, Euphoria, and more.  Growing up, I loved playing guitar and piano and try to play as often as I can when I am home.  I also am one of four kids.  I have a older brother, twin brother, and younger brother.  I love surrounding myself with people who push me to do better, and my family continues to do that.  All these things and more have shaped me into who I am today.

Due to my skills gathered through my classes at Syracuse University, and the interests I have outside of school, I know I can be an asset to many organizations.  I look forward to what the next chapter may bring.</p>
